# Agent Instructions

## When documenting
Always default to brief documentation, only highlighting what's necessary unless asked otherwise. But be sure to (when applicable) include mermaid graphs that help illustrate the data being documented.

## Branch Naming
When creating branches, prefix with `agent/`.

## Refine Step
After each completed change, run a refine step: relevant tests, formatting, linting, compiling, building.
